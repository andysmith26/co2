# Concept Mapping Feature

## Current Status: On Hold

This feature provides an interactive concept mapping visualization for educational content, particularly focused on AP CSP curriculum topics.

## Overview

The concept mapping feature allows users to:

- Visualize relationships between computing concepts as an interactive graph/constellation
- Track their understanding and mastery of concepts
- Create their own connections between related concepts
- Filter and search for specific topics

## Components

- `EnhancedConstellationGraph`: Main visualization component
- `ConceptDetail`: Displays detailed information about a selected concept
- `ConnectionCreator`: Allows users to create connections between concepts
- `ProgressTracker`: Tracks student understanding of concepts

## Data Model

- Concepts: Stored as nodes with labels, descriptions, and types
- Connections: Relationships between concepts with types and descriptions
- Progress: User's understanding level for each concept (not-started, in-progress, mastered)

## Future Plans

This feature is currently on hold while we prioritize the development of project tracking functionality. It will be revisited in a future phase of development.

## Next Steps

- Integration with project tracking
- Enhanced analytics on concept understanding
- Improved visualization options
- Topic expansion beyond the current curriculum scope
